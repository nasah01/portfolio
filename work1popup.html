<h3>Projects and Work (During Graduation) </h3>
<h4>Quiz Website (BSc - 1st Year)</h4>
<h5> Summary of the Project: </h5>
<p class="hhmtext">
Our idea was to make a quiz websites that is directly paired with education. The idea was simple in practice but much more complex on the inside. The website was available for both teachers and students as well as other people who want to use the website to make or use our quizzes. <br />  <br />
The website offered a wide range of courses from it to business and many more as well as a wide range of difficulty levels for all years in order to meet our target audience. Our primary target audience for the site is students and teachers with our secondary being people who just want to use the website. <br /><br />
Our goals were: </p>
<ul class="hhmullitext">
<li>Make a fully functional website</li>
<li>Create a system in which students can learn from, and teachers can manage </li>
</ul>
<br />
<h5>Role: </h5>
<p class="hhmtext">Lead Designer/ Frontend Developer. (Part of a Five Member/ Student Team)</p>
<p class="hhmtext">
I was the lead designer or a frontend developer, for team OUNHA. I spent a good amount of time, figuring out the design for our website with my teammate Umar. <br /> <br />
I made wireframe, which is like a blueprint for the website. It outlines the structure and layout of each page without getting into specific design details. <br /> <br />
This wireframe helped us visualize how the website will flow and ensures that the content is organized in a logical and user-friendly way. <br /> <br />
After that we were ready to move on to the next stage of the design process, where I start adding visual elements and bringing the website to life. <br /> <br />
I used Figma and CSS as my contribution for the team.
